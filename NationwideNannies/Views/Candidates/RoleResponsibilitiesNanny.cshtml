            <div class="about-info">
                <p>As a nanny, you should fulfil all childcare duties whilst your employer’s child is in your care. This will include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Making sure that the child’s emotional needs are met through an understanding and loving demeanour.</li>
                        <li>Providing stimulating activities to encourage the child’s development.</li>
                        <li>Ensuring that the child’s clothes are clean and that they are presentable.</li>
                        <li>Cooking them balanced and healthy meals.</li>
                        <li>Developing social interaction and communication/language skills.</li>
                        <li>Teaching and promoting independence, self-care and hygiene awareness e.g. potty/toilet training.</li>
                        <li>Promoting an active and healthy lifestyle (not plonking them down in front of the television for hours).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>Above all, your role is to provide a loving and stable environment for your employer’s child.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Although each family’s timetable and lifestyle differs, it is generally expected that you should have two days free a week.</li>
                        <li>It is encouraged that you and your employer come to an agreement as to when you will be expected to assist during the evenings and weekends.</li>
                        <li>It is better to have a clear arrangement in place that can then adapt as you get to know each other. </li>
                        <li>You are entitled to 28 days of paid annual leave (if you are working five days a week). Bank and public holidays can be included in the minimum entitlement.</li>
