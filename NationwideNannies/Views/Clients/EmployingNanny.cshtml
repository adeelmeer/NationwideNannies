                                    A Nanny should fulfil all childcare duties whilst your child is in their care. This will include:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Although each family’s timetable and lifestyle differs, it is generally expected that a nanny should have two free days a week.</li>
                                        <li>It is encouraged that you and your Nanny come to an agreement as to when they can be expected to assist you during the evenings and weekends.</li>
                                        <li>It is better to have a clear arrangement in place that can then adapt as you get to know each other.</li>
                                        <li>Nannies are entitled to 28 days of paid annual leave (if they are working five days a week). Bank and public holidays can be included in the minimum entitlement.</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <p>We advise that all the requirements and the agreement between yourself and your nanny is written in a contract, especially for employment exceeding consecutive 12 weeks. The contract can cover the minutest of details. Nationwide Nannies is here to assist clients in devising contracts.</p>
